<h1>TRAIN WITHOUT FEAR</h1>

<p> 

The worst enemy to a climber's progression is the wall the climber never attempts.
<br><br>
Never be stopped again with the Firefly! The Firefly is a revolutionary piece of climbing equipment that allows a climber to recover a quickdraw from any height, so if it's your first clip or your 15th, it doesn't matter as long as you have the Firefly. Feel the freedom of climbing without boundaries. Climb, set, lower, pull - it's that easy.
<br><br>
First, attach the firefly to the top quickdraw. Second, thread a small cord through the hanger and attach it to the firefly. Third, rappel to the ground then pull the cord to operate the Firefly after your weight is off the rope, detach the quickdraw from the hanger and bring it all down from the safety of the ground.
<br><br>
The Firefly allows you to push yourself to try harder climbs without the added stress of potentially losing gear. This gear is for climbers who want to become better.
